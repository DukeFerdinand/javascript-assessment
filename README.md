# My Javascript Assessment Response

I decided to add ES6 support to the application via Babel in order to give myself an easier time writing the application.

### To run the code: 

1. Make sure `npm ` is installed with `npm -v`

1. git clone this repo and `cd` into  the cloned folder

1. OR Open the zip file and `cd` into it

1. Run `npm install && npm run compile`to compile it at least once (or `npm run dev` to watch for changes)

1. Get Weather for pre-approved cities! :)
